# the-curse
The Curse is a 3D horror game demo made in Unreal Engine.

This project was created to learn the 2D and 3D asset pipeline process for Unreal Engine. I imported most assets from the Marketplace and assembled shaders and textures myself. I created dust particle systems and lighting for the scene. I designed and created the UI system that display player stats. I also created various other Blueprints involving character controllers, UI features, player stats, timed systems, and object interactions.
